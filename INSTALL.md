# pptxurlcheck

Parse a PowerPoint PPTX file, extracting all URLs from notes and slides, and
test for validity returning ERR or the non-OK HTTP status code.

## Installing on Linux or OS X

No separate modules are required. Just run `python pptxurlcheck.py`.

## Installing on Windows

Windows users can download and run the EXE file included in the `bin/`
directory.  Copy this file to a location in your PATH (I copy to `C:\Tools`).
